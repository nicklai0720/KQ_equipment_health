# equipment_health
In this case, the Predict_Health_Score_XGBoost.ipynb file is using for trainning models to predict equipments health score, the final evaluate of model is catboost, which has the highest score best on R-square and RMSE.
Move over to the Predict_1D_health.ipynb, it trains a LSTM model for predicting future equipment health score.
Finally, demonstrate all the health result on Online.py.
